# Honcho Configuration

Interactive configuration for the Honcho memory plugin. Uses AskUserQuestion for all menus and selections — never dump numbered text lists.

## Step 1: Status Header

Call `get_config` to load the current state. The response includes a `card` field — a pre-rendered box-drawing card with perfect alignment.

**Output the `card` value exactly as-is inside a code fence.** Do not modify it, re-render it, or add any formatting. Just wrap it in triple backticks:

````
```
{card value here, verbatim}
```
````
- Do NOT show cache info, config paths, or raw JSON.
- Do NOT show warnings unless they indicate something is broken (skip env var shadowing warnings where the values match what's configured).
- If `configExists` is false, tell the user no config exists and offer to create one.

## Step 2: Menu

Present ONE question with these options (the user can select "Other" to reach advanced settings):

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to configure?"
  header: "Config"
  options:
    - label: "Peers"
      description: "Your name and AI name (currently: {resolved.peerName} / {resolved.aiPeer})"
    - label: "Session mapping"
      description: "How sessions are named — per directory, git branch, or per chat (currently: {resolved.sessionStrategy})"
    - label: "Workspace"
      description: "Data space and session scope (currently: {resolved.workspace})"
    - label: "Memory injection"
      description: "What Honcho injects at session start, per turn, and around compaction (currently: start [{resolved.injection.sessionStart}], turn [{resolved.injection.perTurn}], shown in UI [{resolved.injection.showContents}], compaction [anchor {resolved.preCompactAnchor}, re-inject {resolved.injectOnCompact}])"
```

For the "Memory injection" description, use the *effective* values: if `injection.sessionStart` is unset it is `["directives", "summary", "peerCard"]`, and if `injection.perTurn` is unset it is `["userContext"]` (user conclusions on). A stored perTurn value of `"context"` is the legacy name for `"userContext"` — treat them as the same. `injection.showContents` is `[]` when unset — render that as `none`.

If the user selects "Other", present advanced options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Advanced settings:"
  header: "Advanced"
  options:
    - label: "Host"
      description: "Platform / local / custom URL (currently: {current.host})"
    - label: "Context refresh"
      description: "TTL, message threshold, dialectic settings"
    - label: "Message upload"
      description: "Token limits, summarization settings"
    - label: "Statusline"
      description: "Memory statusLine visibility — on / off (currently: {resolved.statusline})"
```

Always include current values in the description so the user can see what's set.

## Step 3: Handle Selection

### Peers

When selected, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which peer to change:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which peer to change?"
  header: "Peers"
  options:
    - label: "Your name"
      description: "Currently: {resolved.peerName}"
    - label: "AI name"
      description: "Currently: {resolved.aiPeer}"
```

Then ask for the new value. Call `set_config` with `peerName` or `aiPeer`.

### Simple fields (Logging, etc.)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask for the new value if there are known options, otherwise ask the user to type it. Call `set_config` with the appropriate field. Show the result.

### Session mapping

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which session mapping strategy?"
  header: "Sessions"
  options:
    - label: "per-directory (Recommended)"
      description: "{peer}-{repo} — one session per project"
    - label: "git-branch"
      description: "{peer}-{repo}-{branch} — session follows branch"
    - label: "chat-instance"
      description: "chat-{id} — fresh each launch"
```

Do NOT use markdown previews for this menu — descriptions are sufficient and previews truncate in narrow terminals.

After strategy selection, ask about peer prefix:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Include your name in session names?"
  header: "Prefix"
  options:
    - label: "Yes — {peerName}-{repoName}"
      description: "For teams sharing a workspace"
    - label: "No — {repoName} only"
      description: "Cleaner for solo use"
```

### Workspace

When selected, present a sub-menu:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Workspace settings?"
  header: "Workspace"
  options:
    - label: "Rename workspace"
      description: "Change workspace name (currently: {resolved.workspace})"
```

#### Workspace > Rename

Dangerous field — requires confirmation. First call `set_config` WITHOUT `confirm: true`. The tool will return a description of what will happen. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Switch workspace to '{value}'?"
  header: "Confirm"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, switch"
      description: "Change to the new workspace"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Keep current workspace"
```

If confirmed, call `set_config` again WITH `confirm: true`.

### Memory injection

Ask all three questions in a SINGLE `AskUserQuestion` call — multi-select each — so the user configures every surface at once. Always include all three, each offering all of its options: the "Show in UI" answers arrive in the same response as "Per turn", so there is no way to narrow them to what the user just enabled. A "Show in UI" pick for a component that is off is harmless — it's stored and takes effect if that component is enabled later. This is the only injection prompt; do not add follow-ups.

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "What should Honcho inject at the start of each session?"
      header: "On start"          # ≤12 chars
      multiSelect: true
      options:
        - label: "Memory directives"
          description: "How to use memory — treat as background, search, save insights"
        - label: "Session summary"
          description: "Rolling long summary of prior sessions"
        - label: "Peer card"
          description: "Your identity + attributes list"
        - label: "Representation"
          description: "Honcho's derived prose profile of you"
    - question: "What should Honcho inject on each user turn?"
      header: "Per turn"
      multiSelect: true
      options:
        - label: "User conclusions"
          description: "Fresh, prompt-scoped memory about you pulled every turn"
        - label: "Assistant conclusions"
          description: "Same fetch, but for the AI peer — what Honcho knows about the assistant"
        - label: "Session messages"
          description: "Recent raw messages from the mapped Honcho session — useful when other instances share the session"
        - label: "Dialectic recall"
          description: "A reasoned answer over your history each turn — richer but slower (off by default)"
    - question: "Which of those should print what they injected to the terminal?"
      header: "Show in UI"
      multiSelect: true
      options:                     # same four labels as "Per turn"
        - label: "User conclusions"
          description: "List each injected conclusion instead of just the count"
        - label: "Assistant conclusions"
          description: "List each injected conclusion instead of just the count"
        - label: "Session messages"
          description: "List each injected message, one truncated line each"
        - label: "Dialectic recall"
          description: "Print the full reasoned answer — prose, can be long"
    - question: "What should Honcho do around a context compaction?"
      header: "Compaction"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Everything (default)"
          description: "Anchor memory before compacting, then re-inject the full package after — upstream behaviour"
        - label: "Skip the re-injection"
          description: "Still anchor before compacting, but the first prompt after gets a one-line pointer instead of the full package"
        - label: "Skip both"
          description: "No anchor before, one-line pointer after — the CLI's own summary already carries recent context"
```

Map the selections to component names, then call `set_config` once per field:
- Session start → `injection.sessionStart`, mapping "Memory directives"→`directives`, "Session summary"→`summary`, "Peer card"→`peerCard`, "Representation"→`peerRepresentation`.
- Per turn → `injection.perTurn`, mapping "User conclusions"→`userContext`, "Assistant conclusions"→`assistantContext`, "Session messages"→`sessionContext`, "Dialectic recall"→`dialectic`.
- Show in UI → `injection.showContents`, same mapping as per turn.
- Compaction → two fields. "Everything" → `injectOnCompact: "full"` + `preCompactAnchor: "full"`.
  "Skip the re-injection" → `injectOnCompact: "slim"` + `preCompactAnchor: "full"`.
  "Skip both" → `injectOnCompact: "slim"` + `preCompactAnchor: "off"`. Both default to `"full"`,
  which reproduces upstream behaviour exactly. `injectOnCompact` also accepts `"off"` (no injection
  at all on the first post-compact prompt, not even the pointer) — offer it only if asked.

Pass the value as a JSON array (e.g. `["directives","summary","peerCard"]`). An empty selection means `[]`: for `injection.sessionStart` and `injection.perTurn` that surface then injects nothing, and for `injection.showContents` (the default) every enabled per-turn component still injects — it just reports a one-line summary (count, tokens, timing) instead of printing its payload.

`showContents` is display-only. It never changes what reaches the model.

Retrieval tuning is intentionally NOT asked here. `injection.searchTopK` (default 10), `injection.maxConclusions` (15), `injection.searchMaxDistance` (0.6, cosine — lower is stricter), and `injection.searchQuerySource` ("prompt" | "topics", default "prompt") are all configurable via `set_config`, but keep the defaults; only mention they're tunable if the user brings it up, and never prompt for them.

If the user enables "Dialectic recall", note the two knobs that shape it — `injection.dialecticTemplate` (the query, with a `%{user_query}` placeholder) and `injection.dialecticReasoning` (tier, default "low") — both via `set_config`. Flag the trade-off: it fires a `chat()` call every non-trivial turn (~12s at medium), on its own budget under the 30s hook ceiling, so it adds real per-turn latency. Keep it off unless the user wants it.

### Dangerous fields (Host)

Host changes require confirmation. First call `set_config` WITHOUT `confirm: true`. The tool will return a description of what will happen. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm, then call again WITH `confirm: true`.

### Context refresh

Use `AskUserQuestion` to pick which setting to change:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which context refresh setting?"
  header: "Refresh"
  options:
    - label: "TTL"
      description: "Cache lifetime — currently {contextRefresh.ttlSeconds}s (default: 300)"
    - label: "Message threshold"
      description: "Refresh every N messages — currently {contextRefresh.messageThreshold} (default: 30)"
    - label: "Skip dialectic"
      description: "Skip chat() in prompt hook — currently {contextRefresh.skipDialectic} (default: false)"
```

Then ask for the new value and call `set_config`.

### Statusline

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Memory statusLine visibility?"
  header: "Statusline"
  options:
    - label: "on (Recommended)"
      description: "Sync status, clickable session link, and live activity"
    - label: "off"
      description: "Hidden"
```

Call `set_config` with field `statusline` and the chosen value. Takes effect on the next statusLine repaint.

### Message upload

Use `AskUserQuestion` to pick which setting to change:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which message upload setting?"
  header: "Upload"
  options:
    - label: "Max user tokens"
      description: "Truncate user messages — currently {messageUpload.maxUserTokens || 'no limit'}"
    - label: "Max assistant tokens"
      description: "Truncate assistant messages — currently {messageUpload.maxAssistantTokens || 'no limit'}"
    - label: "Summarize assistant"
      description: "Use summary instead of full text — currently {messageUpload.summarizeAssistant}"
```

Then ask for the new value and call `set_config`.

## Step 4: Loop

After handling a selection, call `get_config` again to refresh state. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask if they want to configure more:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Configuration updated. What next?"
  header: "Next"
  options:
    - label: "Configure more"
      description: "Return to settings menu"
    - label: "Done"
      description: "Exit configuration"
```

If "Configure more", go back to Step 2. If "Done", show the final status header and exit.

## Guardrails

- ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion for menus and confirmations. Never present numbered text lists.
- Always show the result of `set_config` including any cache invalidation that occurred.
- If a warning about env var shadowing is returned, explain that the env var takes precedence at runtime.
- Never guess values — always ask the user.
- Include current values in option descriptions so the user sees what's set without expanding anything.
- If `get_config` returns `configExists: false`, guide the user to set HONCHO_API_KEY first.
